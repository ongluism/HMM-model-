## Problem Statement

Determine how well the Hidden Markov Model can predict a bikerâ€™s intended turns using GPS coordinates. Furthermore, to improve our ability to correctly predict a biker's next turn, we incorporated clustering by route. In particular, the system is provided clustered historical trips to be trained on. 

## Getting Started

* C++ IDE and Compiler is needed to build and execute our project.
